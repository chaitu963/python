    "Anaconda is similar to pyenv, venv and minconda; it’s meant to achieve a python environment that’s 100% reproducible on another environment, independent of whatever other versions of a project’s dependencies are available. It’s a bit similar to Docker, but restricted to the Python ecosystem.\n",

    "Jupyter is an amazing presentation tool for analytical work; where you can present code in “blocks,” combines with rich text descriptions between blocks, and the inclusion of formatted output from the blocks, and graphs generated in a well-designed matter by way of another block’s code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter is incredibly good in analytical work to ensure reproducibility in someone’s research, so anyone can come back many months later and visually understand what someone tried to explain, and see exactly which code drove which visualization and conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often in analytical work you will end up with tons of half-finished notebooks explaining Proof-of-Concept ideas, of which most will not lead anywhere initially. Some of these presentations might months later—or even years later—present a foundation to build from for a new problem.\n",

    "Your ability to reproduce previous ideas, will quickly decide whether or not you can efficiently build on previous ideas, or needing to start from scratch.\n",
